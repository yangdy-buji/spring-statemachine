== Distributed State Machine Technical Paper

This appendix provides more detailed technical documentation about
using a Zookeeper instance with Spring Statemachine.

=== Abstract

Introducing a "`distributed state`" on top of a single state machine
instance running on a single JVM is a difficult and a complex topic.
The concept of a "`Distributed State Machine`" introduces a few relatively complex
problems on top of a simple state machine, due to its run-to-completion
model and, more generally, because of its single-thread execution model,
though orthogonal regions can be run in parallel. One other natural
problem is that state machine transition execution is driven by triggers,
which are either `event` or `timer` based.

Spring State Machine tries to solve the problem of spanning
a generic "`State Machine`" through a JVM boundary by supporting distributed
state machines. Here we show that you can use generic
"`State Machine`" concepts across multiple JVMs and Spring
Application Contexts.

We found that, if `Distributed State Machine` abstraction is carefully chosen
and backing distributed state repository guarantees `CP` readiness, it is
possible to create a consistent state machine that can share
distributed state among other state machines in an ensemble.

Our results demonstrate that distributed state changes are consistent if the backing
repository is "`CP`" (discussed <<state-machine-technical-paper-introduction, later>>).
We anticipate our distributed state machine can provide
a foundation to applications that need to work with shared distributed
states. This model aims to provide good methods for cloud applications
to have much easier ways to communicate with each other without having
to explicitly build these distributed state concepts.

=== Introduction

Spring State Machine is not forced to use a single threaded execution
model, because, once multiple regions are used, regions can be executed in
parallel if the necessary configuration is applied. This is an important
topic, because, once a user wants to have parallel state machine
execution, it makes state changes faster for independent regions.

When state changes are no longer driven by a trigger in a local JVM or a
local state machine instance, transition logic needs to be controlled
externally in an arbitrary persistent storage. This storage needs to
have a way to notify participating state machines when distributed
state is changed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem[CAP Theorem] states that
it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously
provide all three of the following guarantees: consistency,
availability, and partition tolerance.

This means that,
whatever is chosen for a backing persistence storage, it is advisable
to be "`CP`". In this context, "`CP`" means "`consistency`" and "`partition
tolerance`". Naturally, a distributed Spring Statemachine does not care
about its "`CAP`" level but, in reality, "`consistency`" and
"`partition tolerance`" are more important than "`availability`". This is
an exact reason why (for example) Zookeeper uses "`CP`" storage.

All tests presented in this article are accomplished by running custom
Jepsen tests in the following environment:

* A cluster having nodes n1, n2, n3, n4 and n5.
* Each node has a `Zookeeper` instance that constructs an ensemble with
  all other nodes.
* Each node has a <<statemachine-examples-web>> sample installed,
  to connect to a local `Zookeeper` node.
* Every state machine instance communicates only with a local
  `Zookeeper` instance. While connecting a machine to multiple instances
  is possible, it is not used here.
* All state machine instances, when started, create a
  `StateMachineEnsemble` by using a Zookeeper ensemble.
* Each sample contains a custom rest API, which Jepsen uses to send
  events and check particular state machine statuses.

All Jepsen tests for `Spring Distributed Statemachine` are available from
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-statemachine/tree/master/jepsen/spring-statemachine-jepsen[Jepsen
Tests.]

=== Generic Concepts

One design decision of a `Distributed State Machine` was not to make each
individual state machine instance be aware that it is part of a
"`distributed ensemble`". Because the main functions and features of a
`StateMachine` can be accessed through its interface, it makes sense to
wrap this instance in a `DistributedStateMachine`, which
intercepts all state machine communication and collaborates with an
ensemble to orchestrate distributed state changes.

One other important concept is to be able to persist enough
information from a state machine to reset a state machine state
from an arbitrary state into a new deserialized state. This is naturally
needed when a new state machine instance joins with an ensemble
and needs to synchronize its own internal state with a distributed
state. Together with using concepts of distributed states and state
persisting, it is possible to create a distributed state machine.
Currently, the only backing repository of a `Distributed State Machine` is
implemented by using Zookeeper.

As mentioned in <<sm-distributed>>, distributed states are enabled by
wrapping an instance of a `StateMachine` in a
`DistributedStateMachine`. The specific `StateMachineEnsemble`
implementation is `ZookeeperStateMachineEnsemble` provides
integration with Zookeeper.

=== The Role of `ZookeeperStateMachinePersist`

We wanted to have a generic interface (`StateMachinePersist`) that
Can persist `StateMachineContext` into arbitrary storage and
`ZookeeperStateMachinePersist` implements this interface for
`Zookeeper`.

=== The Role of `ZookeeperStateMachineEnsemble`

While a distributed state machine uses one set of serialized
contexts to update its own state, with zookeeper, we have a
conceptual problem around how to listen to these context changes. We
can serialize context into a zookeeper `znode` and eventually
listen when the `znode` data is modified. However, `Zookeeper` does not
guarantee that you get a notification for every data change,
because a registered `watcher` for a `znode` is disabled once it fires
and the user need to re-register that `watcher`. During this short time,
a `znode` data can be changed, thus resulting in missing events. It is
actually very easy to miss these events by changing data from
multiple threads in a concurrent manner.

To overcome this issue, we keep individual context changes
in multiple `znodes` and we use a simple integer counter to mark
which `znode` is the current active one. Doing so lets us replay missed
events. We do not want to create more and more znodes and then later
delete old ones. Instead, we use the simple concept of a circular
set of znodes. This lets us use a predefined set of znodes where
the current node can be determined with a simple integer counter. We already have
this counter by tracking the main `znode` data version (which, in
`Zookeeper`, is an integer).

The size of a circular buffer is mandated to be a power of two, to avoid
trouble when the integer goes to overflow. For this reason, we need not
handle any specific cases.

=== Distributed Tolerance

To show how a various distributed actions against a state
machine work in real life, we use a set of Jepsen tests to
simulate various conditions that might happen in a real distributed
cluster. These include a "`brain split`" on a network level, parallel
events with multiple "`distributed state machines`", and changes in
"`extended state variables`". Jepsen tests are based on a sample
<<statemachine-examples-web>>, where this sample instance runs on
multiple hosts together with a Zookeeper instance on every node
where the state machine is run. Essentially, every state machine sample
connects to a local Zookeeper instance, which lets us, by using
Jepsen, to simulate network conditions.

The plotted graphs shown later in this chapter contain states and events that
directly map to a state chart, which you can be find in
<<statemachine-examples-web>>.

[[sm-tech-isolated-events]]
==== Isolated Events

Sending an isolated single event into exactly one state machine in an
ensemble is the simplest testing scenario and demonstrates that a
state change in one state machine is properly propagated into other
state machines in an ensemble.

In this test, we demonstrate that a state change in one machine
eventually causes a consistent state change in other machines.
The following image shows the events and state changes for a test state machine:

image::images/sm-tech-isolated-events.png[width=500]

In the preceding image:

* All machines report state `S21`.
* Event `I` is sent to node `n1` and all nodes report state change
  from `S21` to `S22`.
* Event `C` is sent to node `n2` and all nodes report state change
  from `S22` to `S211`.
* Event `I` is sent to node `n5` and all nodes report state change
  from `S211` to `S212`.
* Event `K` is sent to node `n3` and all nodes report state change
  from `S212` to `S21`.
* We cycle events `I`, `C`, `I`, and `K` one more time, through random nodes.

==== Parallel Events

One logical problem with multiple distributed state machines is that, if the
same event is sent into multiple state machines at exactly the same
time, only one of those events causes a distributed state
transitions. This is a somewhat expected scenario, because the first state
machine (for this event) that is able to change a distributed state
controls the distributed transition logic. Effectively, all other
machines that receive this same event silently discard the event,
because the distributed state is no longer in a state where a particular
event can be processed.

In the test shown in the following image, we demonstrate that a state change caused by a
parallel event throughout an ensemble eventually causes a
consistent state change in all machines:

image::images/sm-tech-parallel-events.png[width=500]

In the preceding image, we use the same event flow that we used in the previous sample
(<<sm-tech-isolated-events>>), with the difference that events are always
sent to all nodes.

==== Concurrent Extended State Variable Changes

Extended state machine variables are not guaranteed to be atomic at
any given time, but, after a distributed state change, all state machines
in an ensemble should have a synchronized extended state.

In this test, we demonstrate that a change in extended state
variables in one distributed state machine eventually becomes
consistent in all the distributed state machines.
The following image shows this test:

image::images/sm-tech-isolated-events-with-variable.png[width=500]

In the preceding image:

* Event `J` is send to node `n5` with event variable `testVariable`
  having value `v1`. All nodes then report having a variable named
  `testVariable` with a value of `v1`.
* Event `J` is repeated from variable `v2` to `v8`, doing the same checks.

==== Partition Tolerance

We need to always assume that, sooner or later, things in a cluster
go bad, whether it is a crash of a Zookeeper instance, a state
machine crash, or a network problem such as a "`brain split`". (A brain split is a
situation where existing cluster members are isolated so that only
parts of hosts are able to see each other). The usual scenario is that a
brain split creates minority and majority partitions of an
ensemble such that hosts in the minority cannot participate in an ensemble
until the network status has been healed.

In the following tests, we demonstrate that various types of brain split in
an ensemble eventually cause a fully synchronized state of all the
distributed state machines.

There are two scenarios that have a straight brain split in a
network where where `Zookeeper` and `Statemachine` instances are
split in half (assuming each `Statemachine` connects to a
local `Zookeeper` instance):

* If the current zookeeper leader is kept in a majority, all clients
  connected to the majority keep functioning properly.
* If the current zookeeper leader is left in the minority, all clients
  disconnect from it and try to connect back till previous
  minority members have successfully joined back to existing majority
  ensemble.

NOTE: In our current Jepsen tests, we cannot separate Zookeeper split-brain
scenarios between the leader being left in the majority or in the minority, so we need to
run the tests multiple times to accomplish this situation.

NOTE: In the following plots, we have mapped a state machine error state into an
`error` to indicate that the state machine is in an error state instead of
a normal state. Please remember this when interpreting chart states.

In this first test, we show that, when an existing Zookeeper leader was
kept in the majority, three out of five machines continue as is.
The following image shows this test:

image::images/sm-tech-partition-half-1.png[width=500]

In the preceding image:

* The first event, `C`, is sent to all machines, leading a state change to
  `S211`.
* Jepsen nemesis causes a brain split, which causes partitions
  of `n1/n2/n5` and `n3/n4`. Nodes `n3/n4` are left in the minority, and
  nodes `n1/n2/n5` construct a new healthy majority. Nodes in the
  majority keep functioning without problems, but nodes in the minority
  go into error states.
* Jepsen heals the network and, after some time, nodes `n3/n4` join
  back into the ensemble and synchronize its distributed status.
* Finally, event `K1` is sent to all state machines to ensure that the ensemble
  is working properly. This state change leads back to state
  `S21`.

In the second test, we show that, when the existing zookeeper leader was
kept in the minority, all machines error out.
The following image shows the second test:

image::images/sm-tech-partition-half-2.png[width=500]

In the preceding image:

* The first event, `C`, is sent to all machines leading to a state change to
  `S211`.
* Jepsen nemesis causes a brain split, which causes partitions
  such that the existing `Zookeeper` leader is kept in the minority and all
  instances are disconnected from the ensemble.
* Jepsen heals the network and, after some time, all nodes join
  back into the ensemble and synchronize its distributed status.
* Finally, event `K1` is sent to all state machines to ensure that ensemble
  workS properly. This state change leads back to state
  `S21`.

==== Crash and Join Tolerance

In this test, we demonstrate that killing an existing state machine
and then joining a new instance back into an ensemble keeps the
distributed state healthy and the newly joined state machines synchronize
their states properly.
The following image shows the crash and join tolerance test:

image::images/sm-tech-stop-start.png[width=500]

NOTE: In this test, states are not checked between first the `X` and last the `X`.
Thus, the graph shows a flat line in between. The states are checked
exactly where the state change happens between `S21` and `S211`.

In the preceding image:

* All state machines are transitioned from the initial state (`S21`) into
  state `S211` so that we can test proper state synchronize during the join.
* `X` marks when a specific node has been crashed and started.
* At the same time, we request states from all machines and plot the result.
* Finally, we do a simple transition back to `S21` from `S211` to make
  sure that all state machines still function properly.

=== StateMachine Config Model

`StateMachineModel` and other related SPI classes are an abstraction
between various configuration and factory classes. This also allows
easier integration for others to build state machines.

As the following listing shows, you can instantiate a state machine by building a model
with configuration data classes and then asking a factory to build a
state machine:
