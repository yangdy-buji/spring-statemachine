== Using Deferred Events

When an event is sent, it may fire an `EventTrigger`, which may then cause
a transition to happen, if a state machine is in a state where a trigger is
evaluated successfully. Normally, this may lead to a situation where
an event is not accepted and is dropped. However, you may wish
postpone this event until a state machine enters another state. In that case,
you can accept that event. In other words, an event
arrives at an inconvenient time.

Spring Statemachine provides a mechanism for deferring events for later
processing. Every state can have a list of deferred events. If an event
in the current stateâ€™s deferred event list occurs, the event is saved
(deferred) for future processing until a state is entered that does not list
the event in its deferred event list. When such a state is entered, the
state machine automatically recalls any saved events that are no longer
deferred and then either consumes or discards these events. It is possible
for a superstate to have a transition defined on an event that is deferred
by a substate. Following same hierarchical state machines concepts, the substate
takes precedence over the superstate, the event is deferred, and the
transition for the superstate is not run. With orthogonal regions,
where one orthogonal region defers an event and another accepts the event, the
accept takes precedence and the event is consumed and not deferred.

The most obvious use case for event deferring is when an event causes
a transition into a particular state and the state machine is then returned back
to its original state where a second event should cause the same
transition. The following example shows this situation:

In the preceding example, the state machine has a state of `READY`, which indicates that the machine is
ready to process events that would take it into a `DEPLOY` state, where the
actual deployment would happen. After a deploy action has been run, the machine
is returned back to the `READY` state. Sending multiple events in a
`READY` state does not cause any trouble if the machine is using synchronous executors,
because event sending would block between event calls. However, if the executor uses
threads, other events may get lost, because the machine is no longer in a state where
events can be processed. Thus, deferring some of these events lets the machine
preserve them. The following example shows how to configure such an arrangement:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests2.java[tags=snippetF]
----
====

In the preceding example, the state machine uses nested states instead of a flat
state model, so the `DEPLOY` event can be deferred directly in a substate.
It also shows the concept of deferring the `DONE` event in a
sub-state that would then override the anonymous transition between
the `DEPLOY` and `DONE` states if the state machine happens to be in a
`DEPLOYPREPARE` state when the `DONE` event is dispatched. In the
`DEPLOYEXECUTE` state when the `DONE` event is not deferred, this event would
be handled in a super state.
