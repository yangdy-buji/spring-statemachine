== Reactor Migration Guide
Main task for a work for `3.x` has been to both internally and externally to move and change
as much as we can from imperative code into a reactive world. This means that some
of a main interfaces has added a new reative methods and most of a internal execution locig
(where applicable) has been moved over to handled by a reactor. Essentially what this means is that thread handling model is considerably different compared to `2.x`. Following chapters
go throught all these changes.
