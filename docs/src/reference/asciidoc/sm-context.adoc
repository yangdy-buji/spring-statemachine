== Context Integration

It is a little limited to do interaction with a state machine by
either listening to its events or using actions with states and
transitions. From time to time, this approach is going be too limited and
verbose to create interaction with the application with which a state machine
works. For this specific use case, we have made a Spring-style
context integration that easily inserts state machine functionality
into your beans.

The available annotations has been harmonized to enable access to the same
state machine execution points that are available from
<<sm-listeners>>.

You can use the `@WithStateMachine` annotation to associate a state
machine with an existing bean. Then you can start adding
supported annotations to the methods of that bean.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetA]
----
====

You can also attach any other state machine from an
application context by using the annotation `name` field.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetAA]
----
====

Sometimes, it is more convenient to use `machine id`, which is something
you can set to better identify multiple instances. This ID maps to
the `getId()` method in the `StateMachine` interface.
The following example shows how to use it:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetAAAA]
----
====

You can also use `@WithStateMachine` as a meta-annotation, as shown
in the preceding example. In this case, you could annotate your bean with `WithMyBean`.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetAAA]
----
====

NOTE: The return type of these methods does not matter and is effectively
discarded.

=== Enabling Integration

You can enable all the features of `@WithStateMachine` by using
the `@EnableWithStateMachine` annotation, which imports the needed
configuration into the Spring Application Context. Both
`@EnableStateMachine` and `@EnableStateMachineFactory` are already
annotated with this annotation, so there is no need to add it again.
However, if a machine is built and configured without
configuration adapters, you must use `@EnableWithStateMachine`
to use these features with `@WithStateMachine`.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetAAAAA]
----
====

IMPORTANT: If a machine is not created as a bean, you need to set
`BeanFactory` for a machine, as shown in the prededing example. Otherwise, tge machine is
unaware of handlers that call your `@WithStateMachine` methods.

=== Method Parameters

Every annotation support exactly the same set of possible method
parameters, but runtime behavior differs, depending on the
annotation itself and the stage in which the annotated method is called. To
better understand how context works, see
<<sm-statecontext>>.

NOTE: For differences between method parameters, see the sections that desdribe the
individual annotation, later in this document.

Effectively, all annotated methods are called by using Spring SPel
expressions, which are built dynamically during the process. To make
this work, these expressions needs to have a root object (against which they evaluate).
This root object is a `StateContext`. We have also made some
tweaks internally so that it is possible to  access `StateContext` methods
directly without going through the context handle.

The simplest method parameter is a `StateContext` itself.
The following example shows how to use it:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetB]
----
====

You can access the rest of the `StateContext` content.
The number and order of the parameters does not matter.
The following example shows how to access the various parts of the `StateContext` content:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetBB]
----
====

NOTE: Instead of getting all event headers with `@EventHeaders`, you can use
`@EventHeader`, which can bound to a single header.

[[state-machine-transition-annotations]]
=== Transition Annotations

The annotations for transitions are `@OnTransition`, `@OnTransitionStart`,
and `@OnTransitionEnd`.

These annotations behave exactly the same. To show how they work, we show
how `@OnTransition` is used. Within this annotation, a property's
you can use `source` and `target` to qualify a transition. If
`source` and `target` are left empty, any transition is matched.
The following example shows how to use the `@OnTransition` annotation
(remember that `@OnTransitionStart` and `@OnTransitionEnd` work the same way):

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetC]
----
====

By default, you cannot use the `@OnTransition` annotation with a state and
event enumerations that you have created, due to Java language limitations.
For this reason, you need to use string representations.

Additionally, you can access `Event Headers` and
`ExtendedState` by adding the needed arguments to a method. The method
is then called automatically with these arguments.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetD]
----
====

However, if you want to have a type-safe annotation, you can
create a new annotation and use `@OnTransition` as a meta-annotation.
This user-level annotation can make references to actual states and
events enumerations, and the framework tries to match these in the same way.
The following example shows how to do so:
====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetE]
----
====

In the preceding example,  we created a `@StatesOnTransition` annotation that defines
`source` and `target` in a type-safe manner.
The following example uses that annotation in a bean:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetF]
----
====

=== State Annotations

The following annotations for states are available: `@OnStateChanged`, `@OnStateEntry`, and
`@OnStateExit`. The following example shows how to use `OnStateChanged` annotation (the
other two work the same way):

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetG]
----
====

As you can with <<state-machine-transition-annotations>>, you can define
target and source states. The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetGG]
----
====

For type safety, new annotations need to be created for enumerations by using
`@OnStateChanged` as a meta-annotation. The following examples show how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetGGG]
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetGGGG]
----
====

The methods for state entry and exit behave in the same way, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetGGGGG]
----
====

=== Event Annotation

There is one event-related annotation. It is named `@OnEventNotAccepted`.
If you specify the `event` property, you can listen for a specific event not being
accepted. If you do not specify an event, you can list for any event not being
accepted. The following example shows both ways to use the `@OnEventNotAccepted`
annotation:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetH]
----
====

=== State Machine Annotations

The following annotations are available for a state machine: `@OnStateMachineStart`,
`@OnStateMachineStop`, and `@OnStateMachineError`.

During a state machine's start and stop, lifecycle methods are called.
The following example shows how to use `@OnStateMachineStart` and
`@OnStateMachineStop` to listen to these events:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetI]
----
====

If a state machine goes into an error with exception, `@OnStateMachineStop`
annotation is called. The following example shows how to use it:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetII]
----
====

=== Extended State Annotation

There is one extended state-related annotation. It is named
`@OnExtendedStateChanged`. You can also listen to changes only
for specific `key` changes. The following example shows how to use the
`@OnExtendedStateChanged`, both with and without a `key` property:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests4.java[tags=snippetJ]
----
====
